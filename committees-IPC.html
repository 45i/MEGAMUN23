                    <br>
                    We welcome you to the United Nations Historic Security Council (UNHSC) at the 13th edition of
                    JacoMUN’23.
                    <br>
                    Set at the heights of the Cold War and the subsequent Sino-Soviet Split, this committee is set at
                    what perhaps can be called the most critical juncture in the history of the Asian continent. At a
                    time when new policies are being sophistically constructed between the United States of America and
                    the People’s Republic of China amidst the Sino-Soviet rivalry, we are presented with a crisis in a
                    State that has faced the brunt of control and domination since its very existence, be it from the
                    Vietnamese, the French or the Imperialist Fascist Japanese and now is subject to the horrors of
                    authoritarianism and political radicalism, it is the country that has seen it all: Democratic
                    Kampuchea. This country may differ in name and ideology, be it once as a French protectorate, or a
                    US sponsored Khmer Republic or the currently communistic Khmer Rouge controlled Democratic
                    Kampuchea, however its people have not changed. A period of global political instability has
                    affected the whole world, be it in the echelons of the White House or at the steps of the Great Hall
                    of the People in Beijing, and this is set to fundamentally alter global power dynamics.
                    <br>
                    Delegates, this crisis is not only an impending threat to international peace and security but also
                    calls for immediate action to prevent what can turn into one of the gravest wars of the Century. A
                    delegation in this committee is not only expected to portray exceptional diplomacy, handle the
                    intricacies and complexities of the rapidly destabilizing geopolitical scenario but is also required
                    to sophistically handle their foreign policies without compromising the greater good.
                    <br>
                    Delegates, a little something about myself.
                    <br>
                    I am Tanay Jain, a student of the batch of 22-23 at St James' School. I have a keen interest in
                    Economics, Policy and Entrepreneurship which has led me to pursue Econ at the college level. I
                    started my MUN journey as a class 7 student and 5 years down the line I can only imagine how much of
                    a pivotal role it has played in defining my personality. Apart from Model UN, I am greatly invested
                    in doing debates, business fests and basically anything that gives me a platform to argue and
                    indulge in discourse. Having watched SUITS atleast 6 times now, rest assured that subtle Harvey
                    Specter references would go a long way in establishing your presence in committee. The HSC is the
                    last committee I'd ever chair at JacoMUN and it is definitely the one which would be closest to my
                    heart, hence I'd expect all delegates, first timers or experienced, to make the most out of these 3
                    days by freely expressing their opinions, networking, and most importantly having a lot of fun.
                    Being the flagship committee, the Historic Security Council will surely be one of the most dynamic
                    and complex committees of this conference testing the delegation at every juncture, but I promise
                    it'll have equally fun entertainment motions!
                    <br>
                    Dear Delegates, a small note about myself,
                    <br>
                    I am Aryan Ghosh, a Class XII student belonging to the Humanities Section of St. James’ School,
                    Kolkata, with maths as part of my combination, so do feel free to rant to me about the subject. As
                    cliché as this might sound, MUN has played a key role in my life- Allowing me to understand the
                    complexities of this world and why countries engage in conflict despite calls for peace.
                    <br>
                    In addition to debate and international law, international relations sparks great interest within
                    me, and I always wish to explore further into all three of these avenues, as little as I may know
                    about them. I belong to the offensive realist school of international relations, primarily believing
                    in the idea of great power politics, partly the reason why I selected this agenda for this
                    committee. With a bit of an eccentric knack for poetry and an excessive amount of energy, I look
                    forward to interacting with each and every one of you before, during and after the conference!
                    <br>
                    MUN is not just an event or competition- It is an experience and it is this experience which has
                    helped me grow and I sincerely hope that it helps each one of you to hone your creative abilities
                    and skills! It never is easy, especially in the first few conferences, but I hope that we, as an
                    Executive Board, can help you navigate through its various difficulties.
                    <br>
                    It is genuinely, an honour for me to be Chairperson of this committee and I look forward to three
                    days of intense debate and discussion and hope that each one of you have an immemorable experience.
                    <br>
                    Until then,<br>
                    Acta, non verba,<br>
                    Tanay Jain and Aryan Ghosh,<br>
                    Chairperson of the United Nations Historic Security Council (UNHSC).<br>
                    Secretary General and Under- Secretary General for Research and Policy,<br>
